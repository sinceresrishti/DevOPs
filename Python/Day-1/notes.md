- shell scripting is only designed for linux but python can work on both windows and linux (as a devops engineer we can avoid using python and use ansible instead, ansible is written in pyhton)
- when you want to wrie some complex programs or fetch data from API or perform data manupulation in such cases we'll use python

- simple tasks: go with shell scripting
- advance tasks: go with python scripting
